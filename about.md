Click [here](https://www.16personalities.com/intp-personality) or on the kitten for more info about my personality type. I am an INTP personality type according to the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator. I find this to be fairly accurate and see myself as an introverted person who focuses on my creativity and solving problems. Such as designing this website or any of my other projects on my github page.
