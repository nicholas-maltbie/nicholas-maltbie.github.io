<p>Worked with microsoft on the Azure Networking team as an intern for summer 2020. This was a remote co-op where I was shipped resources and worked from home in Cincinnati Ohio with the rest of my team that was mostly based in Seattle. This was my first time doing remote work so I ran into quite a few difficulties working with the team remotely and with a 3 hour time difference between me and the rest of the team. I managed to stay healthy and safe during the COVID-19 pandemic and was able to develop quite a testing suite and automated workflow reporting for the project.</p>

<p>I enjoyed my time working with Microsoft and look forward to joining them full time next year. This may be the last post in professional for a while if all things go well working at Microsoft.</p>
