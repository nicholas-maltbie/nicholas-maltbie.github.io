<p>I worked at intuit as part of the Mint team. I was working on the backend
notification system using Java, SpringBoot, and AWS. My project for the
summer was setting up a Kafak Connector that would read entries from a
database and forward them as notifications to users. An example of this
would be whenever a data analysis pipeline stored events in a database,
this connector would read out new events in the database at a rate of 
1000x per minute to send notifications.</p>

<p>A big portion of the project was throttling the system and monitoring how
many events were being sent. The system could only handle a fixed number
of messages pre minute from all services so my system had to have a 
configurable messaging rate and not overwhelm other existing systems.</p>

<p>I must say I really enjoyed living in the bay area while completing this internship.
Intuit was quite supportive and helped establish a community amount the interns
while we were working at intuit.</p>

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Developed a high performance networking tool with Kafka, Maven, H2, SQL, Redis, S3, AWS, and Java</li>
  <li>Shipped and tested a user interface to modify server state and configuration with React and Redux</li>
  <li>Increased functional, unit, performance and integration testing for projects from 0% to 100% coverage</li>
  <li>Deployed a service for continuous integration and deployment with Jenkins, AWS, docker, and Github</li>
</ul>
