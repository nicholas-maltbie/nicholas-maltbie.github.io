Hello world, I just made a new project blog for a hobby project i've been working on, Falling Parkour. I'll probably be posting a lot of new content and posts to this page in the near future. Feel free to check it out hosted here - [https://nickmaltbie.com/FallingParkourDevLog/](https://nickmaltbie.com/FallingParkourDevLog/). Check out the first post: [Hello World](https://nickmaltbie.com/FallingParkourDevLog/update/2021/08/13/First-Post.html). 

I also posted a short progress update video on YouTube here showing what the game play looks like right now.

Any comments and suggestions are welcomed. Also, we need a new name for the project :)
