A location based social media app developed for software engineering class during summer 2018. This project is hosted on the domain [https://bark.fyi](https://bark.fyi)

Bark Bark is a web application intended to be a local event finder where you can see what events people are barking at and bark at local events yourself. This social media app helps locate trending events, restaurants and other entertainment while providing additional information with embedded links (e.g. Google Maps, Snapchat).
