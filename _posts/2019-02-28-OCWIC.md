I attended Ohio Celebration of Women in Computing (OCWiC) with other UC students as a male ally. After attending [GHC last year](/blog/2018/11/24/Grace-Hopper-Celebration.html), I was more inspired to take a part in the programs on my campus. OCWiC is a small conference that happens every other year at Sawmill Creek Resort near Sandusky Ohio. It was a great way to network and meet other male allies and women in computer science and engineering.

I did not know that the event was happening until a few weeks before but was still able to sign up to attend with my university. I volunteered to drive all my some of my classmates from UC to the event. This was quite the drive but well worth the trip. While at the event, I got to hear about many research projects that women in engineering were working on. I also got to meet many people who run programs in Ohio like someone from Microsoft TEALS program. The TEALS program was specifically focused on community outreach and relates to the [Bearcat Coders](/honors/2017/10/19/Bearcat-Coders.html) program that I participate in at UC. In addition to finding out about great programs, I also had the opportunity to listen to great speakers.

I had fun, was able to meet many new people, and learned a lot.
